# Simple-GOE
A solution for one of Sethna's "Statistical Mechanics: Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity" problems.

Briefly, it's a program that creates a Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble whose matrices' entries are independent gaussian random variables, and plots the probability distribution of the differences of central eigenvalues divided by their average value.

Constructive criticism for the code is welcome, especially because I am not used to programming.
